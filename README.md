# Gremlin

> A FluidSynth startup service and web interface for Raspberry Pi

## What it does

Gremlin will turn your Raspberry Pi into a portable synth. Just plug in a MIDI keyboard, power up the Pi, and once it's finished booting you can play your keyboard and hear the output through your headphone jack or wherever you route your Raspberry Pi's audio output to.

## Prerequisites

- A Raspberry Pi (tested on Raspberry Pi Model 2 B and higher) running Raspbian
- Configure the Raspberry Pi to boot to console on startup
